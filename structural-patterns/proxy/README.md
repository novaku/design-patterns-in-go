**Proxy** in Go
===============

![Proxy design pattern](https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/proxy/proxy.png)

**Proxy** is a structural design pattern that provides an object that acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client. A proxy receives client requests, does some work (access control, caching,Â etc.) and then passes the request to a service object.

The proxy object has the same interface as a service, which makes it interchangeable with a real object when passed to a client.

Conceptual Example
------------------

A web server such as Nginx can act as a proxy for your application server:

*   It provides controlled access to your application server.
*   It can do rate limiting.
*   It can do request caching.
